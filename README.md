## Index ℹ️
This repoisitory of resources has been organized to categorize topics into different areas to benefit different types of cyber threat intelligence jobs and tasks. While all three types of intelligence are essential for effective decision-making, they differ in their focus, scope, timeframe, and intended users, reflecting the hierarchical levels and operational requirements of the organization or military command.

### Resources for Strategic Intelligence Requirements
