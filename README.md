Cyber Threat Intelligence quotes: 

"If you see dark clouds outside, there's a threat of rain. If you decide to go out without an umbrella, that's a vulnerability. Combine the two and you have the risk of getting soaked." - Anonymous

"Being a threatintel analyst is a constant struggle between wanting to be aware of everything constantly and wanting to understand anything meaningfully" - Nate Beach-Westmoreland
